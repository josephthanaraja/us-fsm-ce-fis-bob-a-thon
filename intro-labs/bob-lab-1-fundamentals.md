## Understanding Bob's Modes

Bob has specialized modes, each optimized for different types of work:

> **🎯 Bob Differentiator: Customizable Modes
>
> Bob's mode system is a key differentiator. The three built-in modes are just the beginning—you can create custom modes tailored to your team's specific workflows (code review, documentation, architecture design, DevOps, etc.). This extensibility makes Bob uniquely adaptable to your organization's needs.

### The Three Core Modes

#### 📋 Plan Mode
**When to use:** Planning, designing, strategizing before implementation

**Perfect for:**
- Designing system architecture
- Planning API endpoints
- Creating database schemas
- Breaking down complex features
- Making technical decisions
- Outlining project structure

**Example prompts:**
```text
Help me design a REST API for a user management system
Plan the database schema for an e-commerce application
What's the best architecture for a microservices-based system?
```

#### 💻 Code Mode
**When to use:** Writing, modifying, or refactoring code

**Perfect for:**
- Implementing features
- Creating new files
- Modifying existing code
- Fixing bugs
- Refactoring code
- Adding tests

**Example prompts:**
```text
Create a user authentication module in Python
Add error handling to the payment processing function
Refactor this code to use async/await
```

#### ❓ Ask Mode
**When to use:** Learning, understanding, getting explanations

**Perfect for:**
- Understanding code concepts
- Getting documentation
- Explaining errors
- Learning best practices
- Comparing technologies
- Clarifying requirements

**Example prompts:**
```text
Explain how JWT authentication works
What's the difference between REST and GraphQL?
Why is this code throwing a NullPointerException?
```

### Switching Between Modes

**To switch modes:**
1. Look for the mode selector at the bottom left of the chat panel
2. Click to see available modes
3. Select the mode you need
4. Bob adapts its behavior immediately

### Mode Practice Exercise

Let's practice switching modes and seeing how Bob's responses differ:

**Step 1: Plan Mode**
Switch to Plan mode and ask:
```text
Help me plan a task management application. What features should I include and how should I structure it?
```

**What to observe:**
- Bob asks clarifying questions about your requirements
- Bob provides architectural guidance
- Bob suggests features and structure without writing code

**Step 2: Ask Mode**
Switch to Ask mode and ask:
```text
What are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, and when should I use each?
```

**What to observe:**
- Bob provides educational explanations
- Bob compares and contrasts concepts
- Bob helps you understand, not just implement

**Step 3: Code Mode**
Switch to Code mode and ask:
```text
Create a simple Python function that validates email addresses using regex
```

**What to observe:**
- Bob writes actual code
- Bob creates files or modifies existing ones
- Bob focuses on implementation

## Approvals and Safe Collaboration

Approvals are Bob's safety mechanism—you stay in control of all changes to your codebase.

### How Approvals Work

When Bob wants to make changes, it:
1. Shows you exactly what it plans to do
2. Displays a preview of the changes
3. Waits for your approval before proceeding
4. Only makes changes after you confirm

### Best Practices for Approvals

**Before approving, always:**
1. ✅ Read the preview carefully
2. ✅ Check which file will be modified
3. ✅ Verify the changes match your request
4. ✅ Look for unintended side effects

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Changes to files you didn't mention
- Deletions of important code
- Modifications that seem too broad
- Anything that doesn't match your intent

### Approval Exercise

Let's practice the approval workflow:

**Step 1: Simple File Creation**
In Code mode, ask Bob:
```text
Create a file called hello.txt with the text "Hello from Bob"
```

**Watch for:**
- Which tool Bob uses (`write_to_file`)
- When the approval prompt appears
- What the preview shows
- The file path and content

**Step 2: Review and Approve**
- Read the preview
- Verify the filename is correct
- Check the content matches your request
- Click "Approve" or "Reject"

### Understanding Auto-Approvals

**Auto-approvals** allow Bob to make multiple changes without asking each time. This is useful for:
- Creating multiple related files
- Making consistent changes across files
- Batch operations

**⚠️ Important Safety Notes:**
- Only enable auto-approvals when you trust the operation
- Review all changes after Bob completes them
- You can always undo changes using version control
- Start with manual approvals until you're comfortable

**To enable auto-approvals:**
1. Look for auto-approval settings in Bob's interface
2. Enable for the current session
3. Bob will make changes more rapidly
4. Review the results when complete

## Hands-On Practice

Now let's put everything together with practical exercises. These work with any programming language or framework.

### Exercise 1: Planning a Feature

**Switch to Plan Mode** and try this:

```text
I want to add a user profile feature to my application. Help me plan:
1. What data should I store?
2. What API endpoints do I need?
3. How should I structure the code?
```

**Bob's Interactive Approach:**
- Bob will ask clarifying questions about your requirements
- Bob helps you think through the design
- Bob provides suggestions while letting you drive decisions

**Respond with your preferences:**
- Answer Bob's questions based on your needs
- Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear
- Iterate until you have a clear plan

### Exercise 2: Creating Files

**Switch to Code Mode** for these quick exercises:

**Step 1: Create a configuration file**
```text
Create a config.json file with basic application settings:
- app name
- version
- environment (development)
Keep it simple.
```

**Step 2: Create a utility function**
```text
Create a utils file in [your preferred language] with a function that formats dates.
Keep it minimal and well-commented.
```

**Step 3: Connect related files**
```text
Create a main file that imports and uses the utility function from utils.
```

### Exercise 3: Understanding Code

**Switch to Ask Mode** and try:

```text
Explain what each file does in simple terms:
- config.json
- utils file
- main file
```

### Exercise 4: Making Improvements

**Back to Code Mode:**

```text
Add error handling to the date formatting function in utils.
Include a comment explaining why error handling is important here.
```
