# Setup Guide

This guide walks you through deploying the SRE Deploy Lab to an OpenShift cluster. The lab showcases how Bob integrates into a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for the SRE use case, using a sample Order Service as the application under deployment.

**Time required:** ~20 minutes for the app (plus ~10 minutes for image builds), ~10 more minutes if adding Jenkins

---

## Prerequisites

Install these tools first (macOS):

```bash
xcode-select --install          # gives you git, make, and curl
brew install openshift-cli      # the oc CLI
brew install podman             # builds container images locally
```

Start the Podman machine (one-time setup):

```bash
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

---

## Step 1: Reserve a TechZone Environment

Go to the [Base OpenShift TechZone collection](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/695ee737853c17e9e412046e/journey-base-open-shift) and select **"OCP-V on IBM Cloud"** to reserve your environment.

When configuring the reservation, select the **16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM** worker node flavor with **100 GB** ephemeral storage. This is the minimum size that comfortably runs all services — smaller flavors run out of CPU for scheduling.

Once your reservation is ready (usually 15-30 minutes), you'll receive credentials on the reservation page:

| Credential | What It's For |
|---|---|
| **API URL** | Used for `oc login` (e.g., `https://api.your-cluster.cloud.ibm.com:6443`) |
| **Cluster admin username** | Login username (e.g., `kubeadmin`) |
| **Cluster admin password** | Login password |
| **OCP Console URL** | Web UI for browsing the cluster (optional) |

Keep this page open — you'll need these values in Step 3.

### What You Get

- OpenShift 4.18 cluster with up to 7 worker nodes (16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM each)
- Public ingress (your app will be accessible via HTTPS)
- A built-in container image registry (no Docker Hub or external registry needed)

---

## Step 2: Install the OpenShift CLI

The `oc` command-line tool is how you interact with the cluster from your terminal.

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install openshift-cli
```

**Other platforms:**
Download from the OCP Console (your TechZone reservation provides the URL) — click the **?** icon in the top-right → **Command Line Tools**.

**Verify it installed:**
```bash
oc version
```

---

## Step 3: Log In to Your Cluster

Use the credentials from your TechZone reservation page:

```bash
oc login --username=<cluster-admin-username> --password=<password> --server=<api-url>
```

Example:
```bash
oc login --username=kubeadmin --password=abc123-XYZ --server=https://api.my-cluster.cloud.ibm.com:6443
```

You may see a certificate warning — type `y` to accept (TechZone clusters use self-signed certs).

> **Tip:** Save your full `oc login` command somewhere handy (e.g., a sticky note or text file). OpenShift tokens expire after a period of inactivity and you'll need to re-authenticate. Having the command ready makes it quick to get back in.

**Verify you're connected:**
```bash
oc whoami        # Should print your username
oc get nodes     # Should list the cluster's worker nodes
```

---

## Step 4: Create a Project (Namespace)

A project is a logical space on the cluster that holds all your app's resources.

```bash
oc new-project sre-deploy-lab
```

---

## Step 5: Enable the Internal Image Registry

OpenShift has a built-in container image registry. On TechZone UPI clusters, it starts disabled. You need to turn it on so the deploy script can push your images.

### 5a: Deploy the Registry

Check if the registry is already running:
```bash
oc get configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.managementState}'
```

- If the output is **`Managed`** — skip to Step 5b.
- If the output is **`Removed`** — deploy it:

```bash
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge \
  --patch '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed","storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
```

Wait for the registry pod to start:
```bash
oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry -w
```

Press `Ctrl+C` once you see `image-registry-xxxxx` at `1/1 Running`.

> **Note:** `emptyDir` storage means images are lost if the registry pod restarts. This is fine for labs — just re-run `make oc-deploy` if it happens.

### 5b: Expose the Registry Route

This creates a public hostname so you can push images from your laptop:

```bash
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge \
  --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'
```

Verify the route was created:
```bash
oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry
```

You should see a hostname like `default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.your-cluster.cloud.ibm.com`.

---

## Step 6: Add Your Bob Shell API Key

Bob CLI runs inside the cluster and provides AI-assisted SRE operations — analyzing PRs, assessing risk, diagnosing pipeline failures, and recommending fixes. You need a Bob Shell API key before deploying.

Check your Slack history for a welcome message from Ask Bob that includes your key. Then create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
BOBSHELL_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

The deploy script reads this file on your machine, creates a Kubernetes Secret on the cluster, and the Bob CLI pod picks up the key from that Secret. The `.env` file stays on your machine — it is not copied into any container.

> **Important:** Never commit the `.env` file to git. It is already in `.gitignore`.

---

## Step 7: Deploy the Application

```bash
make oc-deploy
```

That's it. The script handles everything automatically:

1. Verifies you're logged in and in the right project
2. Gets the registry hostname from the cluster
3. Creates a service account token and logs into the registry
4. Builds container images with `podman build --platform linux/amd64` (safe on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs)
5. Pushes the images to the internal registry
6. Applies security context constraints (so database containers can run)
7. Applies all Kubernetes manifests (dynamically rewrites image references)
8. Builds and deploys the Bob CLI pod with your API key
9. Prints the app URL

**Build times:** Expect ~10 minutes on the first run (downloading base images + cross-compilation on Apple Silicon). Subsequent runs are faster thanks to layer caching.

Once you see `Deployment complete!`, wait for all pods to be ready:

```bash
oc get pods -w
```

Watch until every pod shows `1/1` under the `READY` column. This may take 1-2 minutes as the databases initialize and the services start. Press `Ctrl+C` once they're all ready.

---

## Step 8: Verify the Deployment

**Check pod status:**
```bash
oc get pods
```

All pods should show `Running` with `1/1` ready. It may take 1-2 minutes for all pods to start.

---

## Jenkins CI/CD Setup (Optional)

This section adds Jenkins CI/CD to your OpenShift deployment so you can run the lab scenarios with a live SRE pipeline — PR analysis, PCI compliance checks, risk assessment, and automated change control.

**Prerequisite:** Complete Steps 1-8 above first — all services must be running on the cluster before setting up Jenkins.

### What You'll Need

Before starting, gather these two things:

| Secret | Where to Get It |
|---|---|
| **GitHub Enterprise PAT** | [github.ibm.com/settings/tokens](https://github.ibm.com/settings/tokens) — create a token with `repo` scope |
| **Bob Shell API Key** | Same key from your `.env` file (you already have this from Step 6) |

### Step 9: Deploy Jenkins + Create Pipeline Job

One command does everything — deploys Jenkins, installs plugins, configures credentials, and creates the pipeline job:

```bash
make oc-deploy-jenkins
```

The script will prompt you for your GitHub PAT and Bob API key. Or pass them as environment variables to skip the prompts:

```bash
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxx BOB_API_KEY=sk-xxx make oc-deploy-jenkins
```

**What this does automatically:**

1. Deploys Jenkins on OpenShift with 2Gi memory and 5Gi persistent storage
2. Waits for Jenkins to fully start (2-5 minutes)
3. Installs required plugins (Pipeline, Git, GitHub, Credentials)
4. Creates two credentials in Jenkins (`github-pat` and `bobshell-api-key`)
5. Creates the `sre-pipeline` job pointing to the `Jenkinsfile` in this repo

**First time opening Jenkins UI:** When you visit the Jenkins URL, OpenShift will show a permissions consent screen asking Jenkins to access `user:info` and `user:check-access`. Click **"Allow selected permissions"** — this is standard OpenShift OAuth and lets Jenkins authenticate you as your cluster user. It's a one-time prompt per user.

When the setup script finishes, it prints the Jenkins URL:

```
========================================
  Jenkins setup complete!
========================================

Jenkins UI:     https://jenkins-sre-deploy-lab.apps.your-cluster.cloud.ibm.com
Pipeline job:   https://jenkins-sre-deploy-lab.apps.your-cluster.cloud.ibm.com/job/sre-pipeline/
```

### Step 10: Test It

#### From Jenkins UI

1. Open the Jenkins URL from Step 9 in your browser
2. Click on **sre-pipeline**
3. Click **"Build with Parameters"** on the left sidebar
4. Leave BRANCH as `lab/happy-path` (or change to another lab branch)
5. Click **Build**

Watch the build progress in Jenkins. If you have the app's Pipeline page open with the toggle set to **Live**, events will stream in real-time.

### Step 11: Create Lab Branches (Optional)

The pipeline uses different Git branches to demonstrate different failure scenarios. Each branch is forked from `main` with one targeted change:

| Branch | What's Different | Pipeline Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `lab/happy-path` | Minor change (comment, version bump) | All stages pass, Bob approves |
| `lab/test-failure` | Bug in OrderService — status validation removed | Tests fail, Bob identifies fix |
| `lab/security-vuln` | PCI violation + old base image in Dockerfile | Security scan finds CVEs, Bob analyzes |

Create them from `main` after merging any pending PRs:

```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
git pull

# Happy path — minor change so there's a diff for Bob to review
git checkout -b lab/happy-path
# Make a small change (add a comment, bump a version, etc.)
git commit -am "minor: add coverage notes to README"
git push origin lab/happy-path

# Test failure — remove status validation in OrderService
git checkout main
git checkout -b lab/test-failure
# Edit order-service/src/.../service/OrderService.java
# Remove the status transition validation so unit tests fail
git commit -am "refactor: simplify order status handling"
git push origin lab/test-failure

# Security vulnerability — PCI violation + old base image
git checkout main
git checkout -b lab/security-vuln
# Edit order-service/Dockerfile — change base image to eclipse-temurin:17.0.8-jre-alpine
# Add a System.out.println to trip the PCI checkstyle rule
git commit -am "chore: pin base image version"
git push origin lab/security-vuln
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pods stuck in `ImagePullBackOff`
The registry may have lost its images (emptyDir storage). Re-run:
```bash
make oc-deploy
```

### Database pods stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`
The security context constraint (SCC) patch may not have applied. Check:
```bash
oc get clusterrolebinding sre-deploy-lab-anyuid
```
If it doesn't exist, the script should have created it. Try re-running `make oc-deploy`.

### Pods crash with `exec format error`
Images were built for the wrong CPU architecture. The deploy script uses `--platform linux/amd64` to handle this automatically. If you see this error, make sure you're using the `setup.sh` script (via `make oc-deploy`) and not building images manually.

### `oc login` fails with connection errors
- Double-check the API URL from your TechZone reservation page
- Make sure you're on a network that can reach IBM Cloud (some corporate VPNs may block it)
- If your reservation expired, request a new one

### Order Service not responding
The service or database may still be starting. Wait a minute and check:
```bash
oc logs deployment/order-service --tail=20
```

### Jenkins pod stuck in `Pending`
The cluster may not have enough resources. Check:
```bash
oc describe pod -l name=jenkins
```
Look for "Insufficient cpu" or "Insufficient memory" in the Events section. You may need to scale down other deployments or use a larger TechZone flavor.

### GitHub clone fails with SSL error
`github.ibm.com` uses IBM's internal CA. In Jenkins UI:
1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Global Tool Configuration** → **Git**
2. Add extra git option: `-c http.sslVerify=false`

Or set it cluster-wide for the Jenkins pod:
```bash
oc set env dc/jenkins GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true
```

make pci-check
```

---

## Switching to a New TechZone Environment

When your TechZone reservation expires and you get a new one, just repeat Steps 3-5 and 7 (your `.env` file is already in place):

```bash
oc login --username=<new-user> --password=<new-password> --server=<new-api-url>
oc new-project sre-deploy-lab

# Enable registry (Steps 5a and 5b)
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge \
  --patch '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed","storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
# Wait for registry pod...
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge \
  --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'

# Deploy
make oc-deploy

# Then re-deploy Jenkins (if using it)
make oc-deploy-jenkins
```

No code changes needed. The deploy script detects everything from the cluster automatically. Your lab branches on GitHub Enterprise persist across environments — no need to recreate them.
